0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O


ABOUT:

An introduction to implementing multiple sorting algorithms separately, with -O text files for each algorithm listing their time complexity


FILES :


0-bubble_sort.c : An inefficient sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps two values, the 'cursor' moving from left to right until the array is sorted

1-insertion_sort_list.c : A stable sorting algorithm that is efficient with small data sets and works by inserting a new node into the correct position of a pre-sorted array

2-selection_sort.c : Noted for simplicity, this algorithm typically performs worse than insertion sort, but has some performance advantages. It works by finding the smallest array item and adding it to the end of the sorted area of the array

3-quick_sort.c : Noted for being, as the name implies, significantly quicker than its main competitor algorithms.
